A short story about this website. Why I built it and what technologies I used. What blog articles you can expect to find here.

I have always dreamed of having my own website. A few days ago, this dream came true. Not only do I have a website, but I also have my own blog.

## The Beginning

Let's start at the beginning. Why did I create this site, and why does there need to be another blog on the internet?

Since the first year of my computer science studies and several courses in web development and web design, I have always thought about creating my own portfolio website. 
I don't know why I didn't just start creating it, but I always put it off. I guess it was not important enough. The courses at university and various part-time jobs didn't make it any easier. So for a long time I concentrated on other things. After all, a website and especially a blog need to be maintained. You should be aware of this before you create one. 

At the moment I am doing an internship as a software developer. This means that I have regular working hours and therefore don't have much to do on the weekends. Don't get me wrong. I do have something to do, but not as much as during semesters in university several part-time jobs. 

It was the beginning of a weekend when I decided to start creating this website. And guess what, I had so much fun programming it that I spent the whole weekend doing it.

## Technologies 

You may have found this site via [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Flo0807/). If so, you may have wondered why I built this site with the phoenix framework in Elixir instead of using a static site generator like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). 

I started learning Elixir a few weeks ago as part of my internship. It's by far the least familiar programming language I know, but I was surprised how quickly you can create complex web applications in no time. I decided to take a closer look and continued to learn Elixir in my spare time. Sure, it's overkill for a static portfolio site and a blog, but let's face it, isn't it a programmer's job to make things more complicated than they actually are? In fact, the pages on this site are not normal pages, they are live views. Maybe I will use it to add some real time features in the future.

If you would like to take a closer look at Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView, here are some introductions:

## The Blog

I did not think about a blog when I started creating this website. Initially it was going to be a simple static portfolio site with text that I would never touch again, but some article cards on the home page seemed like a nice idea to add content to the site. All in all it was just one line of code I had to add to the header component to have a blog page. A few days later I wrote the first post on my own blog. Exciting...

## What can you expect?

I plan to add at least one blog post every couple of months, but don't take it too seriously. I don't know yet if it will be a purely technical blog, I'll probably write about anything that comes to mind.

Let me know what you expect from this blog and what topics you are interested in. You can find my contact details on the [about page](https://farens.me/about) of this website. That's one of the reasons I created this website.

I would also love to hear from anyone who has read this first article to the end, so drop me a line anyway.
