A short story about this website. Why I built it and what technologies I used. What blog articles you can expect here.

I always dreamed about having my own website. A few days ago, this dream came true. Not only do I have a website, I also have my own blog now.

## The Beginning

Let's start in the beginning. Why did I create this site and why there has to be another blog on the internet?

Since the first year of my computer science studies and several courses of webprogramming and webdesign, I always thought about creating my own portfolio website. 
I don't know why I didn't just start creating it, but I always put it off. It was probably just not important enough. The courses at university and several side jobs didn't make it easier. So I focused on other things for a long time. After all, a website and especially a blog have to be maintained. You should be aware of this before creating one. 

Currently I am doing an internship as a software developer. This means that I have regular working hours and therefore don't have much to do on the weekends. Do not unterstand me wrong. I do have something to do, but not as much as during semesters in university with multiple side jobs. 

So it was the start of a weekend I decided to start creating this website. And gues what I had so much fun programming it that I spent the whole weekend on it.

## Technologies 

You may found this site through [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Flo0807/). If so, you probably asked yourself why I buit this site with the phoenix framework in Elixir instead of using a static site generator like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). 

I started learning Elixir a few weeks ago as part of my internship. So it's by far the programming language I know the least, but I was surprised how fast you can create complex web applications in no time. I decided to take a closer look and continued learning Elixir in my freetime. Indeed it is overkill for a static portfolio website and a blog, but lets be honest, isn't it the job of a programmer to make things more complicated than they actually are? In fact the pages on this site are not normal pages, they are live views. Maybe I will use it to add some realtime features in the future. 

If you want to take a closer look into Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView here are some introductions:
- https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html
- https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html

In addition you may also look into [the code of this website](https://github.com/Flo0807/website) if not yet done.

## The Blog

I did not think about a blog when I start creating this website. In the beginning it should become a simple static portfolio website with text I never touch again, but some article cards on the home page seemed to be a nice idea to add content to the page. All in all it was only one line of code I had to add in the header component to have a blog page. Some days later I wrote the first article of my own blog. What a journey!

## What can you expect?

I plan on adding at least one blog post every few months, but do not take this too seriously. I still don't know if its going to be a tech only blog, probably I will write about everything that comes to my mind. 

Let me know what you expect from this blog and which topics you are interested in. You can find my contact information on the [about page](https://farens.me/about) of this website. Thats one of the reasons why I created this website.

I am also glad to hear who has read this article to the end, so drop me a message anyway.
