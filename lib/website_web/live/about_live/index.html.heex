      I acquired my software development skills by working on a variety of projects. During my practical studies in Applied Computer Science, I was able to successfully complete numerous projects, both as part of a team and independently. I have also been involved in several research projects and gained professional experience as a software developer. Outside of my studies and work, I am also very passionate about software development. I have already built a few open source projects and enjoy attending conferences and meetups.

      In the last year I have focused more on functional programming. Currently I am building web applications using Phoenix, Elixir and LiveView.

      I find my balance in sport, which I do in a variety of ways. From cycling to functional strength training, I'm always looking for new challenges. This ambition is also reflected in my work and studies.
