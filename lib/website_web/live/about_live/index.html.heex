      As far as programming goes, I have tried a lot. The first web framework I used was Vue.js, followed by React in a university project. For the backend I mainly used Java and TypeScript. I was able to expand my programming experience in two research projects. One project involved the development of an iPad app in Swift and the development of a microservice architecture in Go. Another project involved the development of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in the area of machine learning. I am currently further expanding my skills as part of a student job as a software developer.

      Furthermore, I am very interested in functional programming. I have already gained a lot of experience with Elm and Elixir. Currently, I am developing web applications using the Phoenix web framework and Elixir.

      In my free time I like to do sports. I don't go to the gym very often, I prefer to do sports with people. I love to play badminton and I am enthusiastic about functional strength training. Doing sports gives me a chance to clear my head, in addition to my work and studies.
